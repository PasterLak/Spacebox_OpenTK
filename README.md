A voxel game project called "Spacebox", which is being developed with own game engine. 

⭐️ About the Game

you need to survive in an asteroid belt. Your main tasks include gathering resources, building a base and new ships, and defending against creatures hiding deep inside the asteroids. The game features procedural world generation, and random events add unexpected scenarios, such as emergency breakdowns and attacks. Modding is already available, allowing players to add their own items, blocks, and textures. In the future, we plan to introduce a multiplayer mode to offer more opportunities for cooperative survival and space exploration.
